<h1>Cafe API Website</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is an API I created that can be used to find London cafes that you can bring a laptop to work in, using an SQL database to store all the cafe info.<br>It tells you, if it has wifi, plug sockets, if you can take calls there, if there are toilet facilites and the price of a coffee.</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>When you get to the homepage there are a few options:</p>

<p>'Show all' and 'All Cafes' both bring you to a list of all the cafes currently stored, with the option to click straight on the Google Maps link to see it on the map.</p>
